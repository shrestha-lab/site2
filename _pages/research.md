*Demands for sensory coding can vary tremendously based on context and across diverse timescales*

The physical world we interact with as sentient beings is staggeringly complex and dynamic. How is our nervous system specialized to capture a slice of that vast sensory space most pertinent to us as a species? How do our senses adapt to reliably detect cues even as contexts fluctuate rapidly, or to meet varying sensation needs over an organism's life? Within the conceptual framework of these broad questions, our research program seeks to elucidate cellular and circuit-level features underlying faithful neural representation of ethologically relevant stimuli. To that end, we combine an array of modern molecular genetic tools with functional and behavioral assays to study physical and functional motifs of interest in the mouse auditory system.

Several lines of work in the lab seek to understand how heterogeneity of closely-related neuronal types&mdash;those often lumped as singular class in coarse neural classification schemes&mdash;emerge developmentally and how they subserve stimulus coding.  Although the nervous system is abound with such heterogeneity, sensory neurons offer unique opportunities to map discrete dimensions of neuronal feature variability on to qualitative or quantitative aspects of physical stimuli.

For this reason, our efforts are currently anchored on spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs), the primary sensory neurons of the auditory system. We study mechanisms underlying diversity in connectivity and physiological repertoires of SGNs, stability of their molecular profiles over the life of the animal, and significance of their functional heterogeneity for sound encoding. In doing so, we (1) generate tools for spatiotemporally precise genetic perturbation of SGNs, (2) read, write, impair their activity patterns, (3) chart their transcriptomic and gene regulatory landscapes, (4) perform behavioral assays to probe changes in sound perception.

We strive to traverse multiple scales of inquiry in our scientific pursuits, not only for tools and inspiration but also to generate integrated insights. We have a long-term interest in viewing our discoveries through an evolutionary lens, asking, for instance, how the developmental 'blueprint' we reveal in mice may be implemented variably to produce ethologically suitable sensory abilites across species.
