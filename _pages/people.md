### Head of Laboratory

![Brikha](/images/Brikha_circle.png){:width="30%"}{:style="float: left; margin-right: 1em;"}
##### Brikha Shrestha,  Ph.D.
Brikha grew up in Nepal and attended Brown University, where he studied Neuroscience, wrote for The Critical Review, and performed research on the development of dendritic spines in the mouse hippocampus. He then earned his PhD from the Doctoral Program in Neurobiology and Behavior at Columbia University studying molecular regulation of dendrite morphogenesis in Drosophila. As a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard Medical School, he studied molecular diversity of auditory sensory neurons and uncovered an intriguing phenomenon of postnatal plasticity in their cellular identities. Molecular genetic frameworks underlying neuronal form and function have been his longstanding interests and continue to shape his research goals. Brikha loves to spend time outdoors, exploring hiking trails and bike paths all over New England.

**Fun fact:** Brikha grew up <50 miles from an eight-thousander.

##### Pierrick Bordiga
<h5 style="font-weight: normal">
Postdoctoral Research Fellow
</h5>
Ph.D. in Neuroscience, Université d’Aix-Marseille

Arriving soon...


![Lily](/images/lily_circle.png){:width="30%"}{:style="float: left; margin-right: 1em;"}
##### Lily Xie
<h5 style="font-weight: normal">
Research Assistant
</h5>
B.A. in Biological Sciences, Cornell University

Lily is interested in elucidating the mechanisms that underlie the development and stability of the three SGN Type I subtype identities and in how science informs therapies for human health and hearing. When she's not thinking about science, Lily enjoys learning new languages, creating art, and rock climbing.

**Fun fact:** Lily can passably communicate in at least four other languages.

##### Jiqing (Jacqueline) Zhu
<h5 style="font-weight: normal">
Data Science Specalist
</h5>
M.S. Candidate, Harvard School of Public Health
<br/>
B.S. in Chemistry and Biophysics, Wake Forest University

As a student studying computational biology, Jiqing believes the future of medicine is a collaboration between doctors and AI and is dedicated to developing effective computational tools to assist clinical decision-making and improve health outcomes. In the lab, she helps develop bioinformatics pipelines for single cell transcriptomic analysis. Jiqing has a fashion for puzzles, which left her mom unbothered when she was a kid.

**Fun fact:** Jiqing once memorized the name of every country, its capital, and its location around the world.
